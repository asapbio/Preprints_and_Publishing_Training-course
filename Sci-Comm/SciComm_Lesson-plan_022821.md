**Title:** The communicating scientist: How to effectively and responsibly communicate scientific research

**Main/Overall Objective:** To provide an overview of different platforms used for scientific communication and how to communicate responsibly and appropriately for different audiences. 

**Section Content:**



1. **Understand the role of scicomm as part of being a scientist**
    1. Appreciate the role of the scientist as “chief” communicator and how this fits alongside other professions such as journalists
    2. Understand the requirement of communicating scientific findings as part of being a scientist and from funding bodies
    3. Appreciate the role of scientific communication at different stages in the publishing process from preprint to published article
2. **Develop awareness of the different scientific communication platforms and how to utilise these**
    1. Understand the pros and cons of each of the major platforms
    2. Learn the key skills required to perform effective communication across different platforms 
    3. Practice scientific communication for platforms such as Twitter and Youtube
3. **Understand how to adapt content and communication style to different audiences**
    1. Appreciate that non-specialist audiences require different language and presentation than specialist audiences
    2. Understand how different platforms lend themselves to particular audiences better than others
4. **Understand how to appropriately share science from other groups and combat misinformation and poor science**
    1. Consider best practices for sharing the science of other groups, such as including appropriate caveats and warnings where necessary 
    2. Appreciate the importance of reading and “vetting” articles prior to sharing on social media
    3. Develop skills in combating misinformation and the incorrect use of particular articles

**Reflection:**



*   Which platform is preferred, why?
*   Thoughts on whose role sci-comm is?

 Discussion topics (incl questions to drive discussion):



*   Press releases and preprints - is this appropriate or should we wait until work has been peer-reviewed?
*   Scientific communication as part of being a scientist - whose job is it and why?
