**Title:** Understanding and Engaging with Preprints

**Main/overall objective:** By establishing what is a preprint and discussing the advantages and potential consequences of preprints to both science and scientists, participants can better understand how preprinting can integrate into the traditional journal-based system. Additionally, we will learn what we need to know and consider before preprinting, and how to post your preprint with a practical, step-by-step guide.

**Section Content:**



1. **Preprinting and its impact on the scientific communication, community, and progress**
    1. What is a preprint?
    2. How preprints accelerate scientific communication
    3. How preprints benefit the scientific community
    4. Preprints and research assessment: benefits for scientific career progress
2. **Concerns and consequences of preprinting**
    1. Quality control, peer review, and misinformation
    2. Journal policies and publication
    3. Scooping and open sharing
    4. Impacts on early career progress
3. **Logistics: Preprint components**
    1. Manuscript and data preparation
    2. Preprint servers and data/code sharing platforms
    3. Journal policies and copyright licenses
    4. Initial screening
    5. Versioning and resubmission
4. **A practical, step-by-step guide for posting a preprint**
    1. Overview of how to post a preprint
5. **Activity #1:** Explore preprints in your field on bioRxiv.org or other relevant preprint server and identify key features of preprints discussed in the lesson
    1. For bioRxiv, explore the:
        1.  landing page (Abstract, tweets, comments section)
        2. “Info/History” (DOI, number of revisions, copyright license type, Revision Summary comment)
        3. “Metrics” (Article usage over time)
    2. Links to deposited data and code
6. **Discussion #1**: Are preprints a good platform as compared to traditional publishing? What are the top concerns or benefits of preprints according to the students?

**Materials:**


1. Material 1 - Guidelines for Preprints
    1. Best practices for each section of the manuscript
    2. Checklist for preprints for what needs to be accomplished in terms of data availability

**Reflection:**



1. Key questions to ask at the end to test that the objectives have been met, e.g. do the students feel that preprints are a good platform compared to traditional publishing?
    1. Idea is to have a little bit of a discussion to recap what was learnt.
